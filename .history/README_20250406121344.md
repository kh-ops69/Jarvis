## **Installation**

Make sure you have chrome driver, docker and python3.10 (or newer) installed.

For issues related to chrome driver, see the **Chromedriver** section.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository and setup**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek
mv .env.example .env
```

### 2Ô∏è **Create a virtual env**

```sh
python3 -m venv agentic_seek_env
source agentic_seek_env/bin/activate     
# On Windows: agentic_seek_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Install package**

**Automatic Installation:**

```sh
./install.sh
```

**Manually:**

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# or
python3 setup.py install
```


## Run locally on your machine

**We recommend using at least Deepseek 14B, smaller models struggle with tool use and forget quickly the context.**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download Models**  

Make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed.

Download the `deepseek-r1:14b` model from [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/models)

```sh
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b
```

### 2Ô∏è **Run the Assistant (Ollama)**  

Start the ollama server
```sh
ollama serve
```

Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to `ollama` and provider_model to `deepseek-r1:14b`

NOTE: `deepseek-r1:14b`is an example, use a bigger model if your hardware allow it.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
```

start all services :

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh
```

Run the assistant:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

*See the **Usage** section if you don't understand how to use it*

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Run with an API** section if your hardware can't run deepseek locally*

## Usage

Warning: currently the system that choose the best AI agent routing system will work poorly with non-english text. This is because the agent routing currently use a model that was trained on english text. We are working hard to fix this. Please use english for now.


Make sure the services are up and running with `./start_services.sh` and run the agenticSeek with `python3 main.py`

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh
python3 main.py
```

You will be prompted with `>>> `
This indicate agenticSeek await you type for instructions.
You can also use speech to text by setting `listen = True` in the config.

To exit, simply say `goodbye`.

Here are some example usage:

### Coding/Bash

> *Help me with matrix multiplication in Golang*

> *Scan my network with nmap, find if any suspicious devices is connected*

> *Make a snake game in python*

### Web search

> *Do a web search to find cool tech startup in Japan working on cutting edge AI research*

> *Can you find on the internet who created agenticSeek?*

> *Can you find on which website I can buy a rtx 4090 for cheap*

### File system

> *Hey can you find where is million_dollars_contract.pdf i lost it*

> *Show me how much space I have left on my disk*

> *Find and read the README.md and follow the install instruction*

### Casual

> *Tell me about France*

> *What is the meaning of life ?*

> *Should I take creatine before or after workout?*


After you type your query, agenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task.

Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query.

Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say:

`Do you know some good countries for solo-travel?`

Instead, ask:

`Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel`

## **Run the LLM on your own server**  

If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server. 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£  **Set up and start the server scripts** 

You need to have ollama installed on the server (We will integrate VLLM and llama.cpp soon).

On your "server" that will run the AI model, get the ip address

```sh
ip a | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
```

Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address.

**If you wish to use openai based provider follow the *Run with an API*  section.**

Clone the repository and enter the `server/`folder.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/server/
```

Install server specific requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server script.

```sh
python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333
```

You have the choice between using `ollama` and `llamacpp` as a LLM service.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run it** 

Now on your personal computer:

Change the `config.ini` file to set the `provider_name` to `server` and `provider_model` to `deepseek-r1:14b`.
Set the `provider_server_address` to the ip address of the machine that will run the model.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b
provider_server_address = x.x.x.x:3333
```

Run the assistant:

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh
python3 main.py
```

## **Run with an API**  

Set the desired provider in the `config.ini`

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = openai
provider_model = gpt-4o
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000
```

WARNING: Make sure there is not trailing space in the config.

Set `is_local` to True if using a local openai-based api.

Change the IP address if your openai-based api run on your own server.

Run the assistant:

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh
python3 main.py
```

---



## Speech to Text

The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file:

```
listen = True
```

When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent's name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent's name by updating the `agent_name` value in the *config.ini* file:

```
agent_name = Friday
```

For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like "John" or "Emma" as the agent name

Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent's name aloud to wake it up (e.g., "Friday").

Speak your query clearly.

End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include:
```
"do it", "go ahead", "execute", "run", "start", "thanks", "would ya", "please", "okay?", "proceed", "continue", "go on", "do that", "go it", "do you understand?"
```

## Providers

The table below show the available providers:

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| server    | Yes    | Host the model on another machine, run your local machine |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (set `provider_name` to `lm-studio`)|
| openai    | No     | Use ChatGPT API (non-private)                             |
| deepseek-api  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                                |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |


To select a provider change the config.ini:

```
is_local = False
provider_name = openai
provider_model = gpt-4o
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000
```
`is_local`: should be True for any locally running LLM, otherwise False.

`provider_name`: Select the provider to use by it's name, see the provider list above.

`provider_model`: Set the model to use by the agent.

`provider_server_address`: can be set to anything if you are not using the server provider.

## FAQ

**Q: What hardware do I need?**  

7B Model: GPU with 8GB VRAM.
14B Model: 12GB GPU (e.g., RTX 3060).
32B Model: 24GB+ VRAM.

**Q: Why Deepseek R1 over other models?**  

Deepseek R1 excels at reasoning and tool use for its size. We think it‚Äôs a solid fit for our needs other models work fine, but Deepseek is our primary pick.

**Q: I get an error running `main.py`. What do I do?**  

Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`), your `config.ini` matches your provider, and dependencies are installed. If none work feel free to raise an issue.

**Q: Can it really run 100% locally?**  

Yes with Ollama or Server providers, all speech to text, LLM and text to speech model run locally. Non-local options (OpenAI or others API) are optional.

**Q: How come it is older than manus ?**

we started this a fun side project to make a fully local, Jarvis-like AI. However, with the rise of Manus, we saw the opportunity to redirected some tasks to make yet another alternative.

**Q: How is it better than manus  ?**

It's not but we prioritizes local execution and privacy over cloud based approach. It‚Äôs a fun, accessible alternative!
